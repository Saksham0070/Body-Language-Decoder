Body Language Decoder
Overview
The Body Language Decoder project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to interpret human body language. By using Mediapipe for landmark detection and machine learning algorithms to classify different gestures and expressions, this system can analyze video input and recognize specific poses or gestures in real-time.

Features
Real-time Body Language Detection: Utilizes a webcam feed to detect and interpret various body poses and facial expressions.
Extensive Gesture Recognition: Capable of recognizing and classifying a wide range of gestures such as "Smile", "Sad", "Thank you", "Cheer up", "Wakanda forever", and more.
High Accuracy: Employs advanced machine learning models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Ridge Classifier to ensure accurate predictions.
User-Friendly: Provides visual feedback directly on the video feed, displaying the detected gesture and its probability.
